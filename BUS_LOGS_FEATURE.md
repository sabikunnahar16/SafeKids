# Bus Logs Admin Screen - Feature Summary

## 🚌 **New Bus Logs Feature**

The admin can now view actual bus scan logs based on QR code scans by the bus driver.

### **Key Features:**

#### 🔍 **Search & Filter**
- **Student ID Search**: Enter specific student ID (e.g., STD001)
- **Student Name Search**: Search by student name (partial matches supported)
- **Date Filter**: View logs for specific dates (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **Real-time Search**: Immediate results when search button is clicked

#### 📊 **Status Logic** 
- **IN**: Student was scanned once by bus driver (first scan)
- **OUT**: Student was scanned a second time by bus driver
- **IN/OUT**: Student has both IN and OUT scans for the day
- **N/A**: No scans recorded for that student/date

#### 📱 **Data Source**
- Reads from `inOutRecords` collection in Firestore
- Only shows records where `scannerType = 'bus'` 
- Real scans created by the bus QR scanner, not manual entries

#### 🎯 **Smart Display**
- Groups records by student and date
- Shows IN time and OUT time separately
- Color-coded status badges with icons
- Displays "Not scanned" for missing IN/OUT times
- Includes date information for each record

#### 📋 **Default Behavior**
- Loads today's logs automatically when screen opens
- Shows all students if no search criteria entered
- Includes students with no scans (N/A status) when searching for specific students

### **How It Works:**

1. **Bus Driver Scans QR Code** → Creates record in `inOutRecords` with `scannerType: 'bus'`
2. **Admin Opens Bus Logs Screen** → Fetches all bus scan records 
3. **Admin Searches** → Filters by student ID, name, and/or date
4. **Results Display** → Shows IN/OUT times and status for each student

### **Status Examples:**
- **Student A**: Scanned at 8:00 AM → Status: `IN` (Blue)
- **Student B**: Scanned at 8:00 AM and 3:00 PM → Status: `IN/OUT` (Green)  
- **Student C**: Only scanned at 3:00 PM → Status: `OUT` (Orange)
- **Student D**: No scans recorded → Status: `N/A` (Gray)

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ Shows **actual** bus scanning activity, not manual entries
- ✅ Admin can track which students are using the bus
- ✅ Easy to identify students who missed bus scans
- ✅ Helps monitor bus driver scanning compliance
- ✅ Provides audit trail for attendance tracking

The screen now provides a complete view of bus attendance based on real QR code scans!
